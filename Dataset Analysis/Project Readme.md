Exploring Causes of No Shows to Medical Appointments in Brazil

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

This analysis will explore the dataset to gain insight into questions related to why patients no show to their scheduled medical appointment.

Questions to be explored in this analysis:
- Did the length of time between the appointment being scheduled and the actual appointment day have an impact on whether or not a patient no shows?
- Which age range has a higher frequency of no shows?
- Did male or female patients no show more often?
- Did patients who received an SMS appointment reminder have fewer no shows than patients who did not receive an SMS reminder?
