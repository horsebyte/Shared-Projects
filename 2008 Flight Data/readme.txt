For this project, I explored a flight dataset for the year 2008 provided by the Bureau of Transporation Statistics.

Key Findings:
1. Southwest Airlines flew nearly twice as many flights as any other carrier in this dataset.
2. Southwest Airlines, while flying nearly twice as many flights, also flew shorter routes, on average, than any other carrier in this dataset.
3. ATL (Atlanta International Airport) was the busiest airport in this dataset, yet also served a disproportionally low amount of departing flights by the top five airlines, based on overall number of flights, in this dataset.
4. The airline with the most cancellations was American Eagle
5. The average taxi time for a departing flight was 16.5 minutes
6. The average taxi time for an arriving flight was 6.8 minutes
